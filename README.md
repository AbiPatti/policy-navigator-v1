# Policy Navigator V1
### Abinash Patti

This is my first iteration of a RAG-based application designed to streamline policy compliance queries. It leverages **LangChain**, **Google Gemini**, **Pinecone**, and **Chainlit** to process and retrieve relevant context from documents.

**Project Status:** This repository serves as a proof-of-concept where I learned the fundamentals of **vector embeddings**, **similarity search**, and **LLM orchestration**. 

I am currently archiving this version to rebuild the application using a scalable **microservices architecture** (React Frontend + Flask Backend) in a new repository. I intend to implement a CI/CD pipeline, deploy it, add user feedback, all that production-level stuff.
